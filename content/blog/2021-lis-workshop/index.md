Last Friday afternoon, the 2021 Workshop on Classification and Subject Indexing in Library and Information Science (LIS Workshop) took place organized by the Working Group within the GfKL – Data Science Society. Adrian and Steffen had the chance to present SkoHub in the workshop's first presentation. The slides can be viewed at [https://pad.gwdg.de/p/lis-workshop21-skohub](https://pad.gwdg.de/p/lis-workshop21-skohub).

Here is an overview over the full [programme](http://www.gfkl.org/blog/2019/10/14/lis-workshop-2021-rotterdam/) that comprised six talks:

* Adrian Pohl (hbz, Cologne, Germany) &  Steffen Rörtgen (GWDG, Göttingen, Germany): *SkoHub: Publishing and using knowledge organization systems on the web*
* Colin Higgins (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom): *Justice, governance, and the thesaurus – the Cambridge experience with ‘illegal aliens’*
* Gislene Rodrigues da Silva & Célia da Consolação Dias (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte Brasil): *Subjective aspects of indexing photographs from visual communication using a reading model based on the complex method and the primary functions of the image*
* Heidrun Wiesenmüller (Stuttgart Media University, Stuttgart, Germany): *Orientation and exploration – the presentation of subject headings in German catalog*
* Karin Schmidgall (Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach, Marbach, Germany) & Matthias Finck (Effective Webwork, Hamburg, Germany): *Glückliche Funde - ein Katalog der Forschende auf neue Ideen und Pfade bringt*
* Julijana Nadj-Guttandin (Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, Frankfurt, Germany) & Sarah Pielmeier (University and State Library, Münster, Germany): *Ein neues und modulares Regelwerk für die verbale Inhaltserschließung / A new and modular standard for subject indexing*

The workshop happened as part of the virtual conference “Data Science, Statistics & Visualisation and European Conference on Data Analysis 2021” (DSSV-ECDA 2021). The promotion for the workshop could probably have been better, e.g. the presentations weren't even listed in the regular DSSV-ECDA programme. In the end, the speakers and moderators were among themselves with little additional audience. However, the talks discussed interesting topics and discussion was lively.
